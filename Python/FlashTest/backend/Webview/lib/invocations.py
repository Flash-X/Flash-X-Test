  FlashTest output directory, that is, the big board with the red
  and green lights.  The path to the directory whose contents are
  thus represented is contained in the 'pathToOutdir' member.

  A call to a BigBoard instance's 'quickRegenerate()' method will
  notice site directories added to or removed from 'pathToOutdir'
  since the last time the table was generated and incorporate the
  necessary changes into the table. It will also check known site
  directories for newly-added or removed invocation directories,
  again making changes if necessary. It will *not* notice changes
  made inside an invocation directory of a known site directory,
  because this does not affect the site directory's last-modified
  time. Still, a call to quickRegenerate() should ensure that all
  ordinary changes to a FlashTest output directory are accurately
  reflected in the output of the corresponding BigBoard instance.

  A call to a BigBoard instance's 'spewHtml()' method with a file
  object as an input parameter will write to that file object the
  html that produces the table.
